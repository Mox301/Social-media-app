# Social-media-app
This project is a simple social media app. It has functionality like Facebook (create an account, send message to another user, create a post, comment on it, like on it and so on...).

The goal of this project is to apply Java OOP concepts in an advanced way.

# Installation
This project is written in java, so be sure that Java SE installed in your device then import this project into your IDE. I preferred to use Eclipce IDE.
After that run the main method. You can find the main method in "Social media app\src\Systems.java".
